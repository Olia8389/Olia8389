#Punctuation checklist#
Punctuation provides important clues for comprehension, and it's governed by well-documented rules. Within those rules are stylistic choices.  

**Writing tip**: The more punctuation you add, the more complex a sentence becomes. If a sentence contains more than a comma or two and ending punctuation, consider writing it to make it crisp and clear.

**Useful tips**
* Stick to short, simple sentences.  
* End sentences with a period, regardless of length.  
* Include a colon at the end of a phrase that introduces a list  
 * If one or more list elements complete the introductory phrase preceeding the colon, use a period after every list element.  
 * If all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), don't use a period even if they form a complete sentence with the list introduction.  
 * If a list element contains three or fewer words but one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period after every element.  
* When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless it's a proper noun or the first word in a quotation. 
* Include commas after every item in a series.
* Use a comma following an introductory phrase, to join independent clauses with a conjunction, and to surround the year when you use a complete date within a sentence.   
* Limit the use of semicolons. Rewrite the sentence into multiple sentences or break it into a list.  

**Dashes and hyphens**  
Don't add spaces around dashes or hyphens.
* Set off a paranthetical phrase with more emphasis than paranthesis can provide.
* Indicate interruptions or abrupt shifts in thought.
* Set off a summary or clarification.

**En dash**
* Use to indicate a range of numbers, for a minus sign, or for a negative number. 
* In a compound modifier, use an en dash when one word in the modifier is an open compound or when two or more of the elements are made up of hyphenated compounds.

**Hyphen**
* Use when two or more words work together to modify a noun.
* Hyphenate compound numbers and fractions when they are used as adjectives before a noun.
* Avoid hyphenating when the prefi doesn't cause ambiguity.
